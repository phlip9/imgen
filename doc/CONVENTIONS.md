- Stay focused -- keep changes limited to the task at hand
- User experience > maintainble > readable > compact > performant
- Commits should be atomic, self-contained, and pass all tests
- First refactor to make the change easy, then actually make the change
- Parse don't validate
- Use types to make illegal states unrepresentable
- Avoid useless comments
